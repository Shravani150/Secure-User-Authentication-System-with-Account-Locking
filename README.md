# 🔐 Secure User Authentication System with Account Locking (Java)

This project implements a **secure user login system in Java**, demonstrating two approaches to error handling and validation using Object-Oriented Programming principles.

## 📌 Project Overview
The system enforces **strong password rules**, tracks **login attempts**, and **locks the account** after multiple failed logins.  
Two versions are included to show the evolution of design and error handling.

## 🧩 Implementations

### 1️⃣ Without Exception Handling
- Uses conditional checks and print statements
- Demonstrates basic control flow and validation logic
- Helps understand limitations of print-based error handling

📁 Folder: `without-exceptions`

---

### 2️⃣ With Exception Handling
- Uses **custom checked exceptions**
- Enforces rules at constructor and method level
- Prevents invalid user creation
- Demonstrates clean and secure application design

📁 Folder: `with-exceptions`

---

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- Java OOP (Encapsulation, Abstraction)
- Password strength validation
- Static utility methods
- Custom exception handling
- Defensive programming

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcome
This project highlights **why exception handling is preferred** over print statements for managing errors in real-world Java applications.
